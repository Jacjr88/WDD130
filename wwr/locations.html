                <h2>The Rocky Mountains</h2>
                <p>The Rocky Mountains have long captured the imagination and spirit of exploration. Early American explorers saw them as a fortress 
                    wall to overcome in search of better prospects out west; today they continue to divide the continent between the (still) 
                    wild and generally less developed west and the agricultural stretches of the Great Plains, Midwest, and Atlantic coast. 
                    Despite their impressive presence, you might be surprised to learn that while the Rockies are a combination of 
                    private or public lands – only a small amount is protected as a National Park. It takes about 90 minutes
                     to reach Rocky Mountain National Park from Denver, making it highly accessible and perfect for those in 
                     Denver or those passing through who love the great outdoors.</p>

                <h2>Wairoa River</h2>
                <p>The Grade 5 Wairoa River is renowned for having some of the best white water action in New Zealand. 
                    Kaituna Cascades run the whole of the river including the bottom three rapids and the lower waterfall!
                    After a good safety talk and a few light jokes, your into it.  A few small waves and the first rapid 
                    “Humpty Dumpty” will have you nicely warmed up – before heading straight into ‘Mothers Nightmare’ 
                    which has a technical grade 4 rock garden entrance followed closely by a sweet 2 meter waterfall.
                    Experience the thrill of ‘The Rollercoaster’ –  a long hard and violently fun staircase of whitewater 
                    that will get even the hardest of souls going. Feel the rush of ‘The Waterfall’ which has an 
                    awesome 3 meter drop into a churning pool of white water!  And then continue down through the 
                    rest of the Wairoa Rivers amazing boulder-strewn rock canyon in a combination of awesome 
                    grade 3 & 4 rapids and waterfalls.</p>

                <h2>Middle Fork of the American River</h2>
                <p>The Class IV Middle Fork of the American River rushes through a pristine, secluded 
                    canyon where a melee of pounding whitewater and the beauty of the Sierra Nevada 
                    foothills combine to offer an incomparable California whitewater rafting adventure 
                    near Sacramento. In 1889, in search of gold buried beneath the American River, 
                    miners blasted a tunnel through the side of a cliff to divert the water, creating 
                    one of the most unique whitewater features anywhere in the world. Now known as 
                    “Tunnel Chute,” this tumultuous rapid drops six vertical feet before concluding 
                    with a celebratory float through a 90-foot tunnel. While Tunnel Chute is the 
                    heart-pounding highlight of this thrill-packed Middle Fork American rafting 
                    experience, numerous other Class III & IV rapids make the Middle Fork one of the
                     best rafting trips in the country.</p>
